Simple scripts for Autodesk Fusion 360

Fusion is surprisingly bad software and often even rudimentary things are painful. It is however what most hobbyists use for CAD/CAM, so this is my little effort to cope.

I hate writing Python, so don't expect the code to be beautiful, I only care that it works. Each script is a single file with no dependencies so that they are easy to use. Most are basic tasks with no UI, operating on the current selection. I especially focus on 2d / sketch, since this shockingly buggy and lacking basic ubiquitous 2d tools.
